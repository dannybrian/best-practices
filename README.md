# Best Practices

Developers have evolved a long list of approaches to modules, testing, and above all, front-end frameworks to tackle maintainable JavaScript projects. But in 2020, standards including ES6 modules and custom elements provide most of what is needed. This repo demonstrates one such approach.

Of course, "best practices" never are, with new innovations and improvements constantly moving the target on what is "best". But having myself grown tired of framework opinionation and convention, this repo represents a simple and sensible approach from the perspective of reusable JavaScript for both browsers and NodeJS with minimal dependencies.

## How To 

1. Clone the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/dannybrian/best-practices.git`

2. Install dependencies.
