# best-practices
A zero-dependency (runtime) JavaScript starter template to demonstrate a best practices approach to modules, TDD, and UI components using ES6 and custom elements.

Developers have evolved a long list of approaches to modules, testing, and above all, front-end frameworks to tackle maintainable JavaScript projects. But in 2019, standards including ES6 modules and custom elements provide most of what is needed. This repo demonstrates one such approach.
